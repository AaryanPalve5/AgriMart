# Agrimart - Empowering Farmers to Connect with Global Suppliers

Agrimart is a digital platform designed to bridge the gap between farmers and global suppliers. By providing a direct channel for farmers to source and sell quality products at competitive prices, Agrimart eliminates the need for middlemen and promotes fairer trade. Farmers can upload images and details of products they wish to buy or sell, giving suppliers across the world direct access to their offerings.

## Problem Statement
